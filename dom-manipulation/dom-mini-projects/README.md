# DOM Mini Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of **5 JavaScript DOM Mini Projects** built to strengthen my understanding of **DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI interactions** using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

These projects simulate real-world UI behaviors commonly seen in modern web applications.
