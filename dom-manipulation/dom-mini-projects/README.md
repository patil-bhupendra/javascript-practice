# DOM Mini Projects


A collection of small UI-focused projects built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Projects Included

1. Add Friend Toggle (Single Button)
2. Insta Like Button
3. Custom Cursor Effect


More projects and enhancements will be added soon.
